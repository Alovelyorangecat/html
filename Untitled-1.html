<p>Well I've made it 1200 miles already, and I  passed through some interesting places on the way:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
    <li>Magic City, ID</li>
    <li>Bountiful</li>
    <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
    <li>Why, AZ</li>
    <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>

       My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
       I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
       <ul>
           <li>cell phone</li>
           <li>ipod</li>
           <li>digital camera</li>
           <li>and a peotein bar</li>
           
           Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
           <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
